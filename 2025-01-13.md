Im sort of curious about what kind of coding exercises I should do and how will that impact my ability as a programmer and problem solver. I found this MIT opencourseware class where the final project is building a game of Tetris in pure python, since the course teaches python programming basics. Im curious as to if I can do the assignment, knowing what I know, since its just an introductory course. Here's the course for the assignment:

Im curious as to if I can write this code as an exercise, to simply ahve an mva of writing a few 10 lines of code per day, irresepctive of the fact if those lines of code are ai, or just basic code. Im also curious about buidling things from scratch. i think taht is going to be something Im going to do for a while given that Im trying to learn systems programming alongside gamedev. I will describe a flow of how things will be done soon. 
The mit course also suggests that we read up on Conways game of life for some reason, I might want to look into the course material itself and understand how I can do these small projects to understand deeper concepts.

I need an environment where I can quickly write code and
