I was thinking about a few things in depth, I thought I should jot them down. 
Im very curious about structure nowadays. Structuring my life, my work, the kind of work I want to do going forward. Australia was an eye opener. It exposed me to a new paradigm of work I could do for the coming years, a new chapter of my life where I am sort of ready to let go the whole "Data Engineer" Mould that I was sticking to. 

The structure I was thinking about, is to basically put in place systems and practices for the coming 5 years. The business I want to set up, the kind of software I want to write/master writing. The kind of creative outlets I want to build for monetary and self-fulfillment purposes. And these things have been on my mind for years, I just have never thought about putting them into practice, I feel now is the perfect time.

Foundations are simple, but elaborate. They're like basic punches and kicks, they drive every other complex technique that follows. This piece of your life would have intense thinking ,studying and implementation of concepts you would take with you in every project. This would be things like 
- Math concepts (Probability and Statistics)
- Computer Science Theory (How computer Systems work)
- Design principles. 
The good thing about foundations is that you ahve, them, you just need to keep sharpening them every chance you get. its a consecutive reminder, that needs to be given to yourself once every few days in the midst of a project, to cement your understanding. 

What comes on top of it is application. How foundations and knowledge are applied is through projects. Applications is where you apply what you've learned, and you build stuff. This is the practice part of your life. This is where you work everyday, write a piece of code, and that code does something.
