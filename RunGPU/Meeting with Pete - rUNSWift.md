- Build custom models and load for training. Export model. 
- Labelling Images in High numbers is a problem, becomes laborious. 
- Main task is to get as much data as possible.

- Ball detection
- Jersey Detection 
- Classifications and Object detection. 
	- Robot detection
	- Jersey Classification (Opponent or Home)
	- Goalpost detection
	- Field Lines Detections
	- Ball Detections. 
	-Localization and Kalman Filter. 
All results are stored in the black box of global variables. Which get's stored in the behavior and that dictates action.

Lighting issue for object detection. Can solve by using Synthetically Generated Data using GANs or Diffusion. 

Labelling Problem: Can be multi model (IMage + Language Model) Prompt to draw bounding box around Jersey.
