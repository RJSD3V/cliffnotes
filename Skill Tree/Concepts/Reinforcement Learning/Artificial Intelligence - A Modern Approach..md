### Introduction

Human Performance 
Formal definition of Intelligence - Rationality  = Doing the **Right** thing. 

Thought Process and Reasoning (Psychology) 
X 
Intelligent Behavior based on Rationality - Statistics, Control Theory, Economics.

**cognitive science** brings together computer models from AI and experimental techniques from psychology

Six Disciplines that compose most of AI: 

1. Natural Language Processing
2. Knowledge Representation
3. Automated Reasoning
4. Machine Learning
5. Computer Vision
6. Robotics



## 1. Human Element - Thinking Humnaly.

Cognitive Science. If an algorithm solves something faster than a human, is it ingelligent? 
This is where you basically peek behind the curtain when it comes to intelligent life forms and how they operate.How severl neurophysiological mechanisms work under the hood - and ascertain the semantic content of a person's inner thoughts. A model for Rational Thought alone does not demonstrate Intelligent behavior. It is Rational Thought + Rational Action. 
	
		
## 2. Rationality - Doing the Right thing. 

Aristotle - Irrefutable reasoning processes. Logic. Requires knowledge about the world that is known to be absolutely Certain. Probability Theory fills in the gaps of dealing with uncertain situations. 

## 2.1 Acting Rationally - A Rational Agent. 
	A rational agent is one that acts so as to achieve the best outcome or, when there is uncertainty, the best expected outcome.


A rational agent provides a solid **standard** model for AI. In the discipline itself and outside, I focuses on the study and construction of agents that do the right thing. 
## 3. Thought - Reasoning through problems.
## 4. Behavior - Response patterns given stimuli.
