Rust specialises in providing control to the programmer at a low-level of 
Memory Management, Data Representation and Concurrency. 

Mutability in Rust comes from the `mut` keyword. 

```
fn main(){
let x = 5;
println!("The value of x is : {x}");
x = 6;
//this does not work. You can't mutate variables declared in Rust (unless you use the mut keyword)
print()

}
```
