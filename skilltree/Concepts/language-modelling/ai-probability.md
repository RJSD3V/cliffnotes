We use Probability Theory in AI for two reason: 

1. Design systems and expressions that guide those AI systems. Since probability is a study of uncertainty, this helps us understand how to design systems that reason in the face of uncertainty. 
2. We use probability an statistical analysis to understand the behaviour and analyse the results produced by these designed AI Systems. 
3. While probability theory allows us to make uncertain statements and reason in presence of uncertainty, Information theory allows us to quantify the given uncertainty in a system or probability distribution. 


In designing non-deterministic instruction set where a machine learning algorithm "learns" while drawing estimations of its own while approximating room for error, we use probability theory. 

1. Inherent Uncertainty --> Quantum mechanics - Naturally Occurring Phenomenon
2. Incomplete Observability --> Lack of Data in Observed Sample Space. 
3. Incomplete modelling --> Incapability of model to quantify or  operate  in the frame of reference required to make precise estimations.
